Driving forward into my digital marketing classes, I have a lot to share with you all. While attending my second class, we were introduced to a new area of learning that is LEARN—DO --- TEAC. I always feel knowledge gets upgraded while we teach others and a better understanding of the subject.
While we continue to impart learnings to other, we actually grow. There will be a lot of mistakes that we actually come through while teaching. Mistakes are future benefits, and we should not run from them instead correct ourselves to be prepared for future.

## CONVERSATIONS IN AUTHENTIC WAY

Marketing is always about real conversations with your audience. But we often fail to connect with them because we are unable to have that real Connection. There are a lot of things which run in our mind and make us unclear about our subject. So here we have a learnt about the spices involved for the real connection.
1:1 communication has always been better. Post Covid phase, we won’t be able to connect with our consumers face to face. So we require a digital medium to connect with them.  Emails and messages have come for our rescue. There are certain tricks we need to follow while we follow- up with our audience. 
•	While writing E-mails, feel as if you are interacting with them in a single room.
•	Every person is alone with their devices, so they should feel the real interaction.
•	They will start having mind conversation with you.

## EVERYONE IS NOT YOUR AUDIENCE
IF YOU FEEL EVERYONE IS YOUR AUDIENCE, THEN NO ONE IS YOUR AUDIENCE.
Trying to sell your product to everyone and no one will respond to it. You must have felt this, if u tried doing so. Define your target audience, which will help you to build that trust and 1:1 communication to fetch better results.
