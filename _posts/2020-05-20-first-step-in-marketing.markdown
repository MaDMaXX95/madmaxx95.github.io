Embarking into the new journey of the Digital Marketing. To start in the structured and cohorent manner I have decided to take up the DigitalDeepak Internship Program. I from the automation background and now entering into the digital marketing world I think could make much more success because technology needs automation and reduce the repetative work.
## Economics Importance
After attending the first class I realized before entering into the market or learning any new skills. We have to learn Economics of the Technology . No one can deny that in today's world we need to be multi-facet. If you are good at technology it is not important but the question which market wants is which technology? 

Which trade you are dealing. Only the trade is not the answer.

As the world is moving from organized to unorganized structure laymen is not the acceptable title. Now there is no laymen language it is more complex language which we use to understand. Suggestions given in the first class regarding economics and market just strck me . You can sell any product but the place matter. Product can be sold but where this needs complex algorithms and analysis.
