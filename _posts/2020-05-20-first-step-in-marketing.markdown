Embarking into the new journey of the Digital Marketing. To start in the structured and cohorent manner I have decided to take up the DigitalDeepak Internship Program. I from the automation background and now entering into the digital marketing world I think could make much more success because technology needs automation and reduce the repetative work.

## Why is Economics Important?

After attending the first class I realized before entering into the market or learning any new skills. We have to learn Economics of the Technology . No one can deny that in today's world we need to be multi-facet. If you are good at technology it is not important but the question which market wants is which technology? 

Which trade you are dealing. Only the trade is not the answer.

As the world is moving from organized to unorganized structure laymen is not the acceptable title. Now there is no laymen language it is more complex language which we use to understand. Suggestions given in the first class regarding economics and market just strck me . You can sell any product but the place matter. Product can be sold but where this needs complex algorithms and analysis.

## Communicate to Win

Marketing means communication some take it as manupulation but no it is communication. More you communicate with other person he/she feels more need for certain product. In today's scenario which is called after-COVID-19 era there is less personal interaction there is more visual interaction. So, marketer has to take care of the audience so that they could pursue mass people through Digital means.

As world is changing tools and technology to market also changing rapidly. Video Marketing which contribute most of it because video feels to be the interactive marketing. But, we gone one step ahead these are live webinar , live streaming where we could connect through our audience not face to face but through only dispay pictures and comments.

Webinar and Video Meet are new norm in which people should feel comfortable it is similar to the transition from cash to the cashless economy. The personalization feeling or holding things will disappear. Only the words and interpetation of words will matter while using these type of tools.

## Scope of Digital marketing

After COVID-19 retail stores are moving to the E-commerce platforms. Manufacturer's are rolling out the e-commerce platforms which are ensuring speedy delivery. Now, digital marketing scope have increased three folds. More people are using Internet and India has second largest Internet User database. People are spending average 50% time online. This give the leverage to company market their product more online rather than on hoarding or advertisements. So, the market for the Digital Marketing is vast.
